# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi) 
- Insert command: %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27
- SQL injection into id section of the link to get user information.
- The bug is due to the fact that the URL failed to be sanitizied thoroughly.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- User can obtain invalid CSRF tokens using two different broswers.
- The information therefore can be updated even using an invalid token.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
- The warning will be shown in bold if the user name is correct, while plain if the user name is invalid.
- Through this way, hackers will have a higher chance to get information from innocent users.
- The mistake was made during the HTML development phase.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting
- Inside the "contact us" page, hackers can perform CSS.
- An in-site warning widget will pop out when clicking on the user's feedback.
- The mistake can be fixed by sanitizing the HTML form input and output.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- The URL for each salesperson will reveal a id.
- Changing the id to 10 can lead to another salesperson.
- The other websites fix the problem by sanitizing the data.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
- A login requires a useranme and a password.
- The process can be bypassed by using an old session id or a id that has user logged in previously.
- The error can be fixed by regular session id regeneration.
